        "<p>In game-playing programs, such as chess, it is often not feasible to search through all possible future moves from a given game state, as the branching factor can be very high. Therefore, a static evaluation function is used to estimate the value of a game state based on some features of the state, such as the material on the board, the position of the pieces, and the mobility of the pieces.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>The static evaluation function is typically designed to be fast and efficient, as it is called many times during a search for the best move. The output of the static evaluation function is used to guide the search algorithm towards more promising branches of the game tree.The accuracy of the static evaluation function can greatly impact the performance of the game-playing program. A better static evaluation function can result in better move selection, leading to stronger play. </p>\n",

        "<li>Elephant/Rook: 2 points (It can move upto max width or length of the board which is 3 and max movement can be two steps in either direction)</li>\n",
        "</ul>\n",
